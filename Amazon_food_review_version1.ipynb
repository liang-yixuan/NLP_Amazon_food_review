'' i did receive a reply : `` thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand庐 chips . it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections , and we apologize.our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great ! thanks for providing us with the `` best before '' code from the bag . this really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. < br / > we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand庐 flavors or nut butters , believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase ! in case you buy this product again , we suggest avoiding the same best before date ( if you still have it ) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. < br / > thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks . please let me know if i can be of any more help . '' well the next bag was good . since that time i have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the `` bad '' bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost . i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company . so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle . acquire company with high quality brand recognition , sell product to mass merchants , lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand . increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors . customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand . stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same ...</td>\n",
