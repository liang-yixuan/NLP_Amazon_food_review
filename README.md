# NLP_Amazon_food_review
This repository is the documentation of my Web Analytics and Intelligence course project. 

Project requirement is as follow:

Classification for Online Social Network Analytics
If you wish to use Python to get familiar with Tweet classification, implement the Naive Bayes classifier using Tweets data from the Twitter online social network using the data and code examples available at:
https://github.com/abisee/sailors2017

At the beginning of this project, I learnt from the SAILORS 2017 NLP research project from Standford about Naive Bayes Classification and its implementation on natural language processing. A summary of this project is uploaded as "Whole Process.ipynb" in the repository. 

An application of this Naive Bayes Classification is implemented on the Fine Food Reviews data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

The initial submission (April 24) is only the draft of my project with no proper annotation and final report, which I will get back to after the project is submitted.
